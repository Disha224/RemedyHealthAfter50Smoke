# RemedyHealthAfter50Smoke

I have added all the selenium library on the External Folder of the project.I have also provided the selenium webdriver in the External 
folder.After you download the zip file keep it in one of your Drive and import it to Eclipse IDE and change the path of the webdriver in 
the RemedySharedFunctions class like following:

System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "..//RemedyHealthAfter50//Externals//driver//chromedriver.exe");

Also here is the link of the page where you can see how to install TestNG library in your Eclipse IDE :http://toolsqa.com/selenium-webdriver/install-testng/
